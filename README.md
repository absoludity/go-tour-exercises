# Some ideas for the go-tour exercises.

## Stop and do the [Go-Tour](http://tour.golang.org/)
If you haven't yet worked through the [Go-Tour](http://tour.golang.org/), go
and do so now. If you get stuck, keep struggling, take a break, try again in
a few days, but unless you're not interested in learning, it's probably best
not to look at other peoples' solutions.

If you've got feedback or improvements on my solution here, please let me know
(either here or on the related blog post).
